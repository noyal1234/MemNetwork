# Benchmarks

Product-grade evaluation for brainkm retrieval quality, task success, and latency.
Regenerate on release (local — CI deferred while the repo is private):

```bash
brainkm bench run eval --project-dir .
# or: bash brainkm/scripts/run_eval.sh
```

Individual suites:

```bash
brainkm bench run retrieval
brainkm bench run task
brainkm bench run latency --profile both
brainkm bench run compare   # token proxy only (generous baseline)
```

Optional LLM judge (Ollama): `brainkm bench run task --judge`

## Headline results (MemNetwork project brain, brainkm 0.3.2)

Hardware / corpus: macOS (darwin), hashing embedder (semantic off), **populated** `.brain/brain.db` (~1483 code nodes + project neurons), measured **2026-07-16**.

### Product-grade (`bench run eval`)

| Suite | Metric | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Retrieval** | Recall@1 / Recall@5 | **0.80 / 0.91** (54 ranking queries) | Held-out gold corpus (`retrieval_v1`, 64 queries) |
| **Retrieval** | MRR / nDCG@5 | **0.94 / 0.91** | Ephemeral gold corpus; floors in fixture |
| **Retrieval** | Theme-leak accuracy | **100%** (5/5) | In-corpus noise queries: theme neurons must not appear in top-5 |
| **Retrieval** | Abstain accuracy | **100%** (5/5) | True off-topic queries with abstention enabled |
| **Task** | Gold-fact coverage | **with 100% / without 85%** | 23 MemNetwork tasks; selective-read baseline (not full files) |
| **Task** | Pass rate | **23/23 (100%)** | Hard gate: all `answer_facts` in pack + pack ≤1500 |
| **Latency smoke** | recall / pack p95 | **0.9 / 1.1 ms** | Ephemeral tiny brain; targets ≤150 / ≤250 ms |
| **Latency loaded** | recall / pack p95 | **648 / 758 ms** | Live brain; targets ≤1200 / ≤1500 ms |
| **Eval aggregate** | All cases | **84/84 (100%)** | Includes regression canaries below |

### Token proxy (`compare` — generous baseline)

Naive multi-file dump vs `context_pack`. **Not** the task-success metric; use for savings demos only.

| Scenario | Without | With | Savings |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| token_budget | 9987 | 607 | 16.5× |
| mcp_dispatch | 7014 | 457 | 15.3× |
| graphify_routing | 11074 | 898 | 12.3× |
| session_snapshot | 5241 | 347 | 15.1× |

Average **~94% reduction (~15.7×)** across 4 scenarios.

### Regression canaries (not headline claims)

| Suite | Result | DB |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Abstention | 10/10 | Ephemeral + calibrate |
| DMR-lite | 5/5 | Ephemeral |
| LongMemEval-lite | 10/10 | Ephemeral |
| Budget | 8/8 | Ephemeral |
| Compaction | 3/3 | Ephemeral |
| Token (fixture) | 10/10 | Ephemeral |

## What each suite measures

| Suite | Brain | Standard metric |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `retrieval` | Ephemeral gold corpus | Recall@k, MRR, nDCG@5, theme-leak + abstain accuracy |
| `task` | Live project brain | `answer_facts` answerability + gold coverage vs selective-read |
| `latency` | Smoke ephemeral + loaded live | Cold/warm p50/p95, mean±stdev |
| `compare` | Live | Token savings vs naive file dump (proxy) |
| `eval` | Mixed | All of the above + canaries |

**Fixture vs live:** `retrieval` uses isolated gold neurons (ranking science). `task` and `latency --profile loaded` use the real project brain. Canaries are tiny regression fixtures.

## Task success (with brain vs without)

**Without brain** = selective token-capped excerpts from neighborhood files (Cursor-like partial reads, not whole-file dumps).

**With brain** = bounded `context_pack` from `.brain/brain.db`.

Pass requires **all** `answer_facts` phrases in the with-brain pack (not merely substring coverage). The selective-read baseline is the without arm.

```bash
brainkm bench run task --project-dir .
brainkm bench run task --project-dir . --judge   # optional Ollama rubric
```

One-off probe:

```bash
brainkm bench probe "how does token budget greedy truncation work" --project-dir . \
  --baseline brainkm/brainkm/services/budget.py \
  --baseline brainkm/brainkm/services/context_pack.py
```

## Latency profiles

```bash
brainkm bench run latency --profile smoke   # tight SLOs, empty-ish brain
brainkm bench run latency --profile loaded  # corpus-scaled SLOs
brainkm bench run latency --profile both    # default for eval
```

Loaded targets are calibrated for populated brains (~1k+ code nodes). Smoke targets remain the fast-path SLO.

## Semantic (opt-in)

ONNX MiniLM + CE rerank: `pip install -e "./brainkm[semantic]"` + `brainkm semantic doctor`. Not part of default eval gate.

## Noise control and policy surfacing (0.3.2+)

Product fixes behind the split retrieval metrics and redaction task pass:

- **FTS overlap filter** — multi-token queries drop single-token collision hits (e.g. `learning`, `score`, `gate`) after OR-FTS retrieval.
- **Abstention BM25 floor** — `RecallConfig.min_bm25_strength` (default 3.0) abstains when best BM25 is weak even if percentile would pass.
- **Pack policy surfacing** — code recall hits seed graph neighborhood; `summary_first` preserves policy markers (`remember_neuron`, `redact`, etc.) for rule/decision neurons.

## Before / after product-grade eval

| Dial | Before | After (0.3.2+) |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Retrieval quality | Top-1 pass/fail on 5–10 fixtures | Recall@k / MRR / nDCG on 64-query gold set |
| Noise control | Conflated “abstain” (~70% leak) | Split theme-leak vs true abstain metrics |
| Task success | Token savings only | `answer_facts` answerability vs selective-read |
| Latency | Single profile, empty-brain targets | Smoke + loaded SLOs, cold/warm variance |
| Adoption story | `compare` file-dump proxy | `task` primary; `compare` labeled proxy |
| Judge | None | Optional Ollama `--judge` (soft) |

Exact numbers are environment-dependent; refresh from `bench run eval` on each release. Not CI-regenerated while public workflows are deferred.
